Analyzing associations between cuisine type and rating may give insight into which types of cuisines tend to perform well. Looking at San Diego's population census with 29.6% Hispanic and 17.2% Asian being the highest non-white ethnicities, we predict these cuisines will be associated with high ratings.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) San Diego has notable Vietnamese and Filipino populations, so we will focus on these types of cuisine.\n",

Using survey-based data and statistical analysis, Chun (2020) found that food quality and service quality exhibit the strongest positive correlations with customer satisfaction.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4)\n",
    "\n",
    "Food quality was identified as the strongest predictor of satisfaction, even when controlling for other factors such as price and atmosphere. In the context of this project, food quality can be approximated using information extracted from Yelp review text, including sentiment, tone, and the presence of positive or negative words and phrases. Service quality, defined in the study as staff friendliness and speed of service, also demonstrated a strong positive relationship with customer satisfaction. On Yelp, service quality may be indirectly measured through business attributes such as Good for Groups, Reservations, and Delivery.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weakest, though still positive, correlation observed in the study was associated with the atmosphere and the physical dining environment. Chun (2020) suggests this may be due to variation across restaurant types, such as dine-in versus takeout establishments. Yelp attributes related to atmosphere, including Outdoor Seating, Noise Level, Has TV, and Ambience, can therefore be analyzed in this project to assess whether similar patterns are observed among restaurants in San Diego.\n",

    "We predict that restaurants in San Diego with attributes such as wifi access, longer operating hours, lower average prices, outdoor seating, ample parking, high ambience, reservations, good for groups, and takeout options will be correlated with higher Yelp ratings. We predict that Mexican, Vietnamese, and Filipino cuisines will have higher rating distributions."
