    "San Diego is a growing hub for food, with recent data estimating approximately 5,000 restaurants across the county.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) Highly regarded for its quality Mexican cuisine, San Diego also hosts a variety of different restaurants with popular spots for Asian food, seafood, fusion, fast food, coffee, and desserts. But amidst the vast array of options available, what sets apart a local favorite from a hard “maybe”? Is it outdoor seating to take in the unique climate? Takeout options to expedite food pickups during rush hour? Or pure ambiance to draw in curious passerbys? \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we aim to analyze Yelp data from restaurants in San Diego to identify key features that contribute to a restaurant’s success. We hope our results will provide a better understanding of the San Diego restaurant-goer demographic, from tourists to locals, so that businesses can understand the best way to cater to and enhance the dining experience for their patrons.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin our search for background data we explored a past project with a broader scope of restaurants in the US. It identified differences in rating distributions based on cuisine type, with statistical tests rejecting the possibility of these differences occurring by chance.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) In the context of our project, this motivated us to pursue cuisines as a possible attribute for a restaurant’s success here in San Diego. Analyzing associations between cuisine type and rating may give insight into which types of cuisines tend to perform well. Looking at San Diego's population census with 29.6% Hispanic and 17.2% Asian being the highest non-white ethnicities, we predict these cuisines will be associated with high ratings.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) San Diego has notable Vietnamese and Filipino populations, so we will focus on these types of cuisine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Restaurant attributes such as service quality, price, and atmosphere are broadly applicable across restaurant types and are particularly relevant to online review platforms such as Yelp. Prior research, including Chun (2020), has examined how key restaurant attributes such as food quality, service quality, price, and atmosphere influence customer satisfaction in Mongolia. Using survey-based data and statistical analysis, Chun (2020) found that food quality and service quality exhibit the strongest positive correlations with customer satisfaction.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4)\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been prior research on what attributes on Yelp can contribute to a restaurant’s success. Studies using data from Yelp have found that data is not random and there are common denominators for success. One example found that across the US, restaurants have significant differences in cuisines which show that certain cuisines perform dramatically better than others because of customer’s preferences. Additionally, factors such as delivery options, reservations, and group accommodations were associated with higher star ratings on Yelp. These observations could potentially be found in the San Diego market as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Food quality was identified as the strongest predictor of satisfaction, even when controlling for other factors such as price and atmosphere. In the context of this project, food quality can be approximated using information extracted from Yelp review text, including sentiment, tone, and the presence of positive or negative words and phrases. Service quality, defined in the study as staff friendliness and speed of service, also demonstrated a strong positive relationship with customer satisfaction. On Yelp, service quality may be indirectly measured through business attributes such as Good for Groups, Reservations, and Delivery.<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5)\n",
    "\n",
    "The weakest, though still positive, correlation observed in the study was associated with the atmosphere and the physical dining environment. Chun (2020) suggests this may be due to variation across restaurant types, such as dine-in versus takeout establishments. Yelp attributes related to atmosphere, including Outdoor Seating, Noise Level, Has TV, and Ambience, can therefore be analyzed in this project to assess whether similar patterns are observed among restaurants in San Diego.\n",

Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Yelp reviews tend to be highly positive or highly negative, could miss out on \"eh\" experiences. Review bombing and bot reviews are also items to consider as confounds in our data.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Yelp API does not pull personally identifiable information.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Yelp ratings, different attributes create a wide variety of criteria to choose from.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n"
